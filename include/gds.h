/* GDS(Generic Data Structures) is a C library designed to aid C developers in their development process by providing them with data structures
 * they can use throughout their projects. Besides efficiency, this library prides itself with robust error and program consistency checks.
 * All functions return crystal clear error codes, with each module(data structure) having a local scope for its error codes. The library
 * utilizes defensive programming to its maximum capacity by making sure that long, "procedurally-designed" functions perform defensive checks
 * each step of the way.
 *
 * Error Handling -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * Each data structure has a base value for its error codes(for example, GDSArray has 1000 as its base value). Some functions will return
 * simple indicators that the function failed(for example, NULL or -1, indicating a NULL argument). More complex functions will return
 * error codes. These functions have their own error code base values(for example gds_array_assign() has a base value of 10, built upon
 * the 1000 for GDSArray - meaning 1010). These error codes provide a way for the program to tell the user what went wrong. Most of these
 * refer to user error, for example, appending to the array when its at its max capacity.
 *
 * Error codes that have 'FERR' in them indicate that the error is fatal - the state of the data structure is compromised. These error codes
 * exist but may never happen.
 *
 * However, some of the error codes, denoted by the _ prefix in the macro definition, occur when the program fails due to invalid program 
 * state(perhaps happening due to an unhandled situation in the library source code). The library, by default, won't check for them and won't
 * return them. This is because, if these situations occur, it can be assumed that the library behavior is at fault.
 * A user may decide to enable them, find the error and fix the error for himself.
 * For exmaple, in theory, gds_vec_at() function must not fail if given the correct parameters) - but gds_vec_assign() will
 * perform the check nonetheless. A user may also decide to enable these checks if every bit of robustness is valued - while a small
 * decrement in performance is not an issue. To enable this, uncomment the macro below and recompile the library.
